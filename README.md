# Lip-Reading-web-app-using-ML

What is Lip-Reading ?
Lipreading is a process of extracting speech by watching lip movements of a speaker in the absence of sound. Humans lipread all the time without even noticing. It is a big part in communication albeit not as dominant as audio. It is a very helpful skill to learn especially for those who are hard of hearing.

In this project, i have created web-app using streamlit as User Interface.
