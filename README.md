## **What is Lip-Reading ?**
Lipreading is a process of extracting speech by watching lip movements of a speaker in the absence of sound. Humans lipread all the time without even noticing. It is a big part in communication albeit not as dominant as audio. It is a very helpful skill to learn especially for those who are hard of hearing.

Deep Lipreading is the process of extracting speech from a video of a silent talking face using deep neural networks. 

In this project, i have created web-app using streamlit as User Interface.
